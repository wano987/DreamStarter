Single-function modular PHP framework for noobs

Due to irrevelance I decide to force it's development by opensource it's test builds.

Main features:
- Can be used for PHP newbies as starting framework, yet it can be used as high-weight modular solution
- layer-based architecture
- No OOP, only one *(or three for safety purposes)* functions to make it work
- OOP-like scripting model
